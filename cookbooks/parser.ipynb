Sometimes, updates can resolve underlying issues with BitLocker.\\n\\n2. **Check for Hardware Changes**: If you've recently made any hardware changes (like replacing the motherboard or hard drive), this could trigger BitLocker to ask for the recovery key. Reverting any recent hardware changes may help.\\n\\n3. **Reset TPM**: If the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is causing issues, you can reset it. To do this, enter the BIOS/UEFI settings during startup and look for the TPM settings. Resetting it may require you to reinitialize BitLocker.\\n\\n4. **Disable and Re-enable BitLocker**: If possible, you can try disabling BitLocker completely and then re-enabling it. This can sometimes reset any misconfigurations that are causing the recovery key prompts.\\n\\n5. **Check Group Policy Settings**: Ensure that the Group Policy settings related to BitLocker are correctly configured. Sometimes, incorrect settings can lead to issues with recovery key prompts.\\n\\n6. **Consult Microsoft Support**: If none of the above steps work, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support for more specialized assistance.\\n\\nIf you need further help or clarification on any of these steps, feel free to ask!\\n\\nLanguage:\\nENGLISH\\n\\nTop K RAG Contexts:\\n\\nHow to fix a slow computer.pdf#page=3\\n\\nUnable to connect Outlook and Teams shows error CAA20002.pdf#page=2\\n\\nVeeva - Customer Maintenance DCR Provider updates.pdf#page=5\\n\\nVeeva Call Unlock.pdf#page=1\\n\\nVeeva - Customer Maintenance DCR Provider updates.pdf#page=2\"}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'function_call': None, 'max_tokens': 2000, 'seed': 123, 'temperature': 0, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'Followup'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'Followup', 'description': 'Followup questions structure for testing', 'parameters': {'properties': {'followup': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'title': 'Followup', 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['followup'], 'type': 'object'}}}], 'top_p': 1}}"
